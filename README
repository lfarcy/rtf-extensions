Description
-----------
RTF-Extensions is a Ruby library that adds a few useful extensions to the
excellent Ruby RTF package originally developed by Peter Wood.

Features
--------
RTF-Extensions has two main interests for Ruby developers who write code for
generating RTF documents.

  1. It can handle character strings encoded in UTF-8 and generate RTF documents
     that preserve those Unicode characters.
  2. It offers a facility to add hyperlinks to a RTF document.

RTF-Extensions is NOT a replacement for Ruby RTF. It comes as an addition and
shall be used on top of the original Ruby RTF.

How to install RTF-Extensions
-----------------------------
First you'll have to install Ruby RTF. The simpliest way is to get it as a gem

  sudo gem install rtf

Since RTF-Extensions is not available (yet) as a gem, you have to get a copy of
the few Ruby files it's made up of. The simpliest way is to download the archive
from the homepage of the project on GitHub.

You can also clone the git repository.

  git clone git@github.com:lfarcy/rtf-extensions.git

Finally, make sure that this copy is on your load path. For instance, in a Rails
application, copy the rtf/ sub-directory in RAILS_ROOT/lib.

How to use RTF-Extensions
-------------------------
Here's a typical code snippet that shows how to use it.

  # load Ruby RTF first
  require 'rtf'
  # then load extensions
  require 'rtf/utf8'
  require 'rtf/hyperlink'
  
  doc = RTF::Document.new
  
  # hyperlink example
  doc.paragraph() do |p|
    p << "Visit "
    p.hyperlink('http://www.google.com', 'Google')
    p << " and start searching the web."
  end
  
  # utf8 - works only if the Ruby script if UTF8 encoded itself...
  utf8_string = "â鋸"
  doc.paragraph do |p|
    p << "A UTF-8 encoded string : #{utf8_string}"
  end
  
  File.open('my_document.rtf') { |file| file.write(doc.to_rtf) }
